Data Collection: APIs provide a standardized way to access vast amounts of data from various sources such as financial markets, social media, weather services, and more. This data is essential for training, validating, and testing ML models.
Real-time Data: APIs allow ML models to receive real-time data, which is particularly useful for applications like stock price prediction, weather forecasting, and real-time recommendation systems.
